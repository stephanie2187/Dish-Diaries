# Dish-Diaries

# Introduction:
A personal project, full-stack web app that allow users to visually track dishes and restaurants they've visited, associated with ratings, names, and locations. I was inspired by my family and friends' love of trying new food spots together, and wanted to create a clean and simple way for us to privately document those memories and dishes.

# Challenges Faced:
I faced difficulties implementing the backend of the site with Firebase hosting, storage, and authentication due to unfamiliarity with the service. However, I learned a lot of new skills in estalishing the Firebase environment and the cloud through this project. 

# Improvements:
As this project is still a work-in-progress, I'm currently working on the UI and visual design components of the site, via CSS.

# Built with:
HTML, CSS, JS, Firebase Hosting/Storage/User authentication, Google Maps API
